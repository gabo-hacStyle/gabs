                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                You were the shadow to my light <br>Did you feel us?<br>
                Another start You fade away <br>
                Afraid our aim is out of sight <br> Wanna see us<br>Alight <br> 
                <h3>Bridge</h3>
                Where are you now? (3x) <br> Was it all in my fantasy? <br>
                Where are you now? <br> Were you only imaginary? <br>
                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                Where are you now? <br> Atlantis,  Under the sea, Under the sea <br> Where are you now?
                <br> Another dream <br> The monster's running wild inside of me <br>
                I'm faded (2x) <br>
                So lost,I'm faded,<br> I'm faded, So lost, I'm faded <br>
                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                These shallow waters never met what I needed <br> I'm letting go, A deeper dive <br>
                Eternal silence of the sea <br> I'm breathing <br> Alive <br>
                <h3>Bridge</h3>
                Where are you now? <br> Where are you now? <br> Under the bright but faded light <br>
                You set my heart on fire <br> Where are you now? (2x) <br>
                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                Where are you now? <br> Atlantis,  Under the sea, Under the sea <br> Where are you now?
                <br> Another dream <br> The monster's running wild inside of me <br>
                I'm faded (2x) <br>So lost,I'm faded, I'm faded, 
                <br> So lost, I'm faded <br>

                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                You were a slave to your sin <br>
                Did you feel it? <br> Lack of freedom, and happiness <br> Afraid that others 
                would have known it, <br> It was real <br> And now <br>
                <h3>Bridge</h3>
                Where are you now?(3x) <br> It was not all a fantasy <br> Where are you now? <br>
                It all was real in you.
                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                Where are you now? <br>Alive, in every breathe, in every breathe<br>
                Where are you now? <br> Another day <br> In which you have been saved by His grace
                <br> You are saved (x2) <br> Not lost, You are saved, 
                <br> You are saved, Not lost, You are saved
                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                These false distractions never met what you needed <br>You let Him in, a deeper love <br>
                Eternal life He promised <br> You are breathing <br> Alive <br>
                <h3>Bridge</h3>
                What to do now? <br> What can you do now? <br> Under the sky, before time comes, <br>
                can set your heart on fire <br> Where are you know? (x2) <br>
                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                 What can you do now? <br>
                Go preach it, to those around, to those around you <br> What to do now? Another one <br>
                Go catch them with the love you have received <br> Let´s save them (x2)
                <br> The lost <br>Let´s save them, Let´s save them, 
                <br> The lost, Let´s save them.
